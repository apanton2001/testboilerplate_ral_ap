# Security Practices and Compliance

This document outlines the security measures implemented within the Automated Customs Documentation Platform and considerations for compliance.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Authentication and Authorization
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure stateless authentication using JSON Web Tokens. Tokens are signed with a secret key (`JWT_SECRET` environment variable).
- **Password Hashing:** User passwords are securely hashed using `bcrypt` before storing in the database.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Middleware (`backend/src/middleware/roleAuth.js`) restricts access to specific API endpoints based on user roles (Admin, Reviewer, Clerk) defined in the database.

### 2. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Server-Side Validation:** The `express-validator` library is used extensively across all backend API routes (`backend/src/routes/`) to:
    - Validate data types, formats, lengths, and ranges.
    - Sanitize inputs (trimming whitespace, escaping potentially harmful characters) to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
- **Centralized Validation Handling:** A middleware (`backend/src/middleware/validation.js`) consistently handles validation errors, returning clear 422 responses.

### 3. API Security
- **Rate Limiting:** `express-rate-limit` middleware is applied globally and potentially fine-tuned on sensitive endpoints (like login) in `backend/src/index.js` to mitigate brute-force attacks.
- **Security Headers (Helmet):** The `helmet` middleware is used in `backend/src/index.js` to set various HTTP security headers, including:
    - `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS.
    - `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking.
    - `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME-sniffing.
    - `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information leakage.
    - `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`: Controls DNS prefetching.
    - Others (Content-Security-Policy handled separately by frontend).
- **CORS Configuration:** The `cors` middleware in `backend/src/index.js` is configured to allow requests only from the specified frontend origin (`FRONTEND_URL` environment variable), preventing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

### 4. Frontend Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Defined in `frontend/next.config.js` via HTTP headers. It restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, fonts, connect-src for APIs), significantly reducing the risk of XSS attacks. The policy includes `upgrade-insecure-requests`.
- **Other Headers:** `next.config.js` also sets `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, and a basic `Permissions-Policy`.

### 5. Data Security
- **Encryption in Transit:** HTTPS is enforced via the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. Ensure deployment environments (Vercel, AWS ELB/CloudFront) are configured for HTTPS termination.
- **Encryption at Rest:** While not explicitly implemented in the application code, this should be configured at the database level (e.g., using PostgreSQL encryption features or AWS RDS encryption).
- **Secrets Management:** Sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, JWT secret) is managed through environment variables (`.env` file, not committed to Git) and configured securely in deployment environments (Vercel Environment Variables, AWS Parameter Store/Secrets Manager).

### 6. Error Handling and Logging
- **Secure Error Messages:** Centralized error handling (`backend/src/middleware/errorHandler.js`) prevents leaking sensitive stack traces or internal details to the client in production environments. User-friendly messages are shown instead.
- **Structured Logging:** `winston` provides detailed, structured logs (`backend/logs/`) for auditing, debugging, and monitoring potential security events without logging overly sensitive data.

### 7. Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies (`npm audit`, Dependabot) to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Compliance Considerations (GDPR/Local Laws)

- **Data Minimization:** Collect only necessary user data (email, name, password hash).
- **User Rights:** Implement mechanisms for users to access, modify, or delete their data (requires further development).
- **Consent:** Ensure clear consent mechanisms if collecting additional personal data.
- **Data Residency:** If required, ensure database and hosting infrastructure (AWS regions) comply with geographic data residency requirements.
- **Breach Notification:** Establish procedures for notifying relevant authorities and affected users in case of a data breach.

## Further Recommendations

- **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF (e.g., AWS WAF, Cloudflare) in front of the application for an additional layer of protection against common attacks.
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Implement MFA for user logins, especially for privileged roles (Admin, Reviewer).
- **Session Timeouts:** Implement session inactivity timeouts (managed via JWT expiration and potentially client-side logic).
- **Regular Backups:** Configure regular, automated backups for the PostgreSQL database.
- **Detailed Audit Logging:** Enhance logging to capture specific user actions related to sensitive data access or modifications.
